# Emacs-appimage
Unofficial AppImage for the latest Emacs version.

This is built using the official PPA for the previous (not the latest, not the older) Ubuntu LTS.

###### NOTE: *This repository is inspired by [github.com/probonopd/Emacs.AppImage](https://github.com/probonopd/Emacs.AppImage) and created to make sure that "AM" and AppMan users don't get left behind!*
