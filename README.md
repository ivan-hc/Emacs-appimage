This repository provides Unofficial AppImages of Emacs built on top of [JuNest](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest) and the scripts to built them.

You can download the last continuous version from [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Emacs-appimage/releases/tag/continuous).

The old Emacs-28_28.1.1 (ir the last version available from Ubuntu's PPA, being it no more updated) is available [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/Emacs-appimage/releases/tag/28.1.1).

###### NOTE: *This repository is inspired by [github.com/probonopd/Emacs.AppImage](https://github.com/probonopd/Emacs.AppImage) and created to make sure that "AM" and AppMan users don't get left behind!*

-------------------------
### Reduce the size of the JuNest based Appimage
You can analyze the presence of excess files inside the AppImage by extracting it:

    ./*.AppImage --appimage-extract
To start your tests, run the "AppRun" script inside the "squashfs-root" folder extracted from the AppImage:

    ./squashfs-root/AppRun

---------------------------------

## Install and update it with ease

I wrote two bash scripts to install and manage the applications: [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager) and [AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan). Their dual existence is based on the needs of the end user.

| <sub>***If you want to install system-wide applications on your GNU/Linux distribution in a way that is compatible with [Linux Standard Base](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml) (all third-party apps must be installed in dedicated directories under `/opt` and their launchers and binaries in `/usr/local/*` ...), just use ["AM" Application Manager](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager). This app manager requires root privileges only to install / remove applications, the main advantage of this type of installation is that the same applications will be available to all users of the system.***</sub>

| <sub>***If you don't want to put your app manager in a specific path but want to use it portable and want to install / update / manage all your apps locally, download ["AppMan"](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan) instead. With this script you will be able to decide where to install your applications (at the expense of a greater consumption of resources if the system is used by more users). AppMan is portable, all you have to do is write the name of a folder in your `$HOME` where you can install all the applications available in [the "AM" database](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager/tree/main/programs), and without root privileges.***</sub>
